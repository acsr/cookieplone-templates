# Cookieplone Documentation Starter

Powered by [Cookieplone](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone) and [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), [Cookieplone Documentation Starter](https://github.com/plone/cookieplone-templates/documentation_starter) is intended to be used by Plone developers to create comprehensive documentation for Plone add-ons using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) and [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [reStructuredText](https://www.docutils.org/rst.html).
