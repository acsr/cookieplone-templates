# File system structure

This reference document describes the file system structure of {{ cookiecutter.__folder_name }}, and the purpose of its files and directories.

**{{ cookiecutter.title }}** uses [Sphinx Theme Builder](https://sphinx-theme-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for compiling static assets and previewing design changes.
**{{ cookiecutter.title }}'s** file structure follows [that of Sphinx Theme Builder](https://sphinx-theme-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filesystem-layout/), with some slight variations.
