# File system structure

This reference document describes the file system structure of Plone Sphinx Theme, and the purpose of its files and directories.

Plone Sphinx Theme uses [Sphinx Theme Builder](https://sphinx-theme-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for compiling static assets and previewing design changes.
Plone Sphinx Theme's file structure follows [that of Sphinx Theme Builder](https://sphinx-theme-builder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filesystem-layout/), with some slight variations.
